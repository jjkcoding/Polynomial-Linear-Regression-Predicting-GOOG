## Summary
This project aimed to predict future closing prices of GOOG stock by utilizing a Polynomial Linear Regression Model based on historical closing price data of GOOG and AAPL stocks as support. The historical data used in the analysis was cleaned using various data cleaning techniques to ensure high-quality data was used. Through this project, the focus was to gain insights into Polynomial Regression Modeling, forecasting data, and constructing prediction intervals on a time series dataset. By analyzing the past trends of the stock market, this project sought to forecast the potential outcomes of future GOOG closing prices with a higher degree of accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project explores the use of a polynomial linear regression model on time series data to forecast and predict future data points. Although the model did not accurately predict exact future data points, it was still able to provide a rough idea of the overall shape of the future data points. The project provided valuable learning experiences in polynomial linear regression, forecasting and predicting future data points using the model, and creating prediction intervals and visualizations of the data. Overall, the project contributed to a deeper understanding of the capabilities and limitations of polynomial linear regression modeling on time series data.
